# Outlander

outlander is a language (the kind you speak, not the kind you write software in) spoken by two polities of fictional aliens on the outskirts of a particular star system. 

These aliens have a very inhuman vocal tract (the set of organs responsible for generating speech sounds), and humans cannot speak their languages. They likewise cannot utter human speech. Their languages have very few sounds when compared to human speech, relying much more on timing subtle changes of pitch and volume to convey meaning. To a human, their speech sounds like the quiet yipping and growling made by a dreaming dog.
